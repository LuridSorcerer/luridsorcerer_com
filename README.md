# Lurid Sorcerer Website

WordPress is a little much. Honestly, I don't need a complex CMS, I don't need all the features and plugins and themes it provides, and I don't need the headaches of trying to keep it secure. Coding in HTML, CSS, and JS have been my thing for a while, so I don't see any reason I couldn't just write up static pages like I used to. It's not pretty (I'm not a designer) but it's simple, fast, and functional. 

I plan on adding to this repo in the future as I develop the site. This may involve complete re-writes or changes in the development stack. A switch to Angular might be cool, and I want to code a character sheet and campaign manager for the Kalarsys site. 

If you want to fork this repo and use it for your own site, you may want to reconsider. However, I won't stop you. On the other hand, if you peruse the code and find something useful, don't hesitate to let me know.
